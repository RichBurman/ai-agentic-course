My name is Richard Burman. I am a junior software developer. I am currently living in England, but have lived all over the world, in Germany and Nepal in the past. 
I love all foods, particularly pizza and steaks and particularly a fan of cheese in the Christmas period. I really enjoy my fitness and since October 2025 have been running 3 times a week and now complete 5k runs 3 times a week.
